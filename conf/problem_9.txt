**Problem 9: The Rotating Matrix Code**

**Domain:** Pattern Recognition / Spatial Reasoning

**Problem Statement:**

A 3x3 matrix of characters is used to generate a code. The code generation involves two steps:
1.  **Transformation:** The matrix undergoes a specific sequence of three transformations:
    *   T1: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise.
    *   T2: Flip horizontally.
    *   T3: Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
2.  **Code Reading:** After the transformations, the code is read by concatenating the characters from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

You are given the final code: "**X3HMA1S2P**"

And you know the initial state of the matrix before any transformations was:
`A B C`
`D E F`
`G H I`

Where A-I are unknown characters (but are represented by the characters appearing in the final code string). Your task is to determine the configuration of the initial matrix.

**Task:**
Reconstruct the initial 3x3 matrix of characters.
