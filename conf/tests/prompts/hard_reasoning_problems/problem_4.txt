**Problem 4: The Mystery Crop Failure**

**Domain:** Knowledge Integration / Causal Reasoning

**Problem Statement:**

A remote farming community relies on a single large field, Field Alpha, for its primary grain crop. For generations, they've used a consistent crop rotation schedule: Grain (Year 1) -> Legumes (Year 2) -> Fallow (Year 3), then repeat. They use traditional farming methods and no synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. The climate is stable.

This year (Year 1 of a new cycle, so Grain was planted), Field Alpha suffered a catastrophic crop failure â€“ almost no grain grew. However, a smaller, geographically isolated field, Field Beta, also planted with the same grain seeds from the same supplier, and also in Year 1 of its own identical rotation cycle, had a perfectly normal, bountiful harvest. Field Beta is 5 miles away, upstream along the valley's only river, and has slightly different soil composition (more clayey than Alpha's loamy soil).

The community elders recall the following events over the past three years:

1.  **Three Years Ago (During Alpha's Fallow Year / Beta's Fallow Year):** A new, small-scale artisanal pottery workshop was established beside the river, between Field Alpha and Field Beta. The workshop uses local river clay. They rinse their tools and clay residues into a settling pond system, which is supposed to prevent clay particles from directly entering the river. The workshop had a minor incident where some untreated clay slurry accidentally washed directly into the river for a day.
2.  **Two Years Ago (During Alpha's Grain Year / Beta's Grain Year):** Both fields had successful grain harvests. The community noted an increase in migratory bird populations that year, particularly species that feed on insects.
3.  **One Year Ago (During Alpha's Legume Year / Beta's Legume Year):** Field Alpha had a below-average but acceptable legume harvest. Field Beta had a normal legume harvest. Some community members noted that the river water downstream of the pottery workshop sometimes looked a bit cloudier than usual, even after the workshop upgraded its settling ponds after the initial incident. No specific crop diseases were identified in Field Alpha's legumes.
4.  **This Year (During Alpha's Grain Year - Failure / Beta's Grain Year - Success):** The crop failure in Field Alpha. Field Beta is fine. Early in the growing season, there was a period of unusually heavy rainfall for one week, causing the river to swell but not significantly flood Field Alpha (water didn't go over the banks more than a few feet).

**Task:** Identify the most probable primary cause for the crop failure in Field Alpha this year. Explain your reasoning by linking the events and observations.
