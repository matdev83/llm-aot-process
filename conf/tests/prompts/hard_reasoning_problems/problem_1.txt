**Problem 1: The Alien Artifact**

**Domain:** Logic Puzzle / Spatial Reasoning

**Problem Statement:**

Archaeologists have discovered an alien artifact, a perfect cube, made of smaller, identical cubic components. Each component is either "active" (A) or "inactive" (I). The artifact projects a holographic symbol based on the arrangement of its active components.

The artifact is a 3x3x3 cube (composed of 27 smaller cubes). Scientists have determined the following from partial scans:

1.  There are exactly 10 active components.
2.  No two active components share a face (they can share edges or corners).
3.  The central component of the entire 3x3x3 cube is inactive.
4.  If you look at any of the six faces of the large cube, the 2x2 sub-grid in the top-left corner of that face contains exactly two active components.
5.  There is at least one active component in each of the 3 "layers" (bottom, middle, top).
6.  The bottom layer has more active components than the top layer.

**Task:** Determine the exact 3D arrangement of the 10 active components. Represent your answer by listing the coordinates (x, y, z) of each active component, where x, y, z can be 0, 1, or 2. Assume (0,0,0) is one corner and (2,2,2) is the opposite corner. The layers are defined by the z-coordinate (z=0 is bottom, z=1 is middle, z=2 is top).
