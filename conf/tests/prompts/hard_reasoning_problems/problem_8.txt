**Problem 8: The Autonomous Vehicle Dilemma**

**Domain:** Ethical Reasoning (Logical Solution Path)

**Problem Statement:**

An autonomous vehicle (AV) company is programming its vehicles' decision-making algorithms for unavoidable accident scenarios. They are considering three ethical principles to prioritize:

1.  **P1 (Minimize Harm):** The AV should always choose the action that results in the least amount of total harm (e.g., fewest injuries or fatalities). Harm is quantified: minor injury = 1 unit, major injury = 5 units, fatality = 10 units.
2.  **P2 (Protect Occupants):** The AV should prioritize the safety of its own occupants above all else. If an action guarantees occupant safety (i.e., avoids fatality or major injury for occupants), it should be chosen, regardless of harm to others (unless it violates P3).
3.  **P3 (Uphold Legal Responsibility):** The AV must not take any action that would be clearly illegal for a human driver in the same situation (e.g., intentionally swerving onto a crowded sidewalk if pedestrians have right-of-way, even if it saves the occupant from a different threat). This principle acts as a hard constraint.

The company has decided on a hierarchical application of these principles: **P3 > P2 > P1**. This means P3 is checked first; if an action violates P3, it's discarded. Then, among P3-compliant actions, P2 is applied. If P2 yields a clear choice (one option demonstrably better protects occupants from severe harm compared to other options), that choice is made. If P2 does not yield a clear choice (e.g., all options equally risk occupants, or multiple options equally save occupants from severe harm), then P1 is used to select among the remaining valid options.

Consider the following scenario:
The AV is carrying one occupant. Suddenly, a large truck ahead jackknifes, blocking the AV's lane. The AV cannot stop in time. It has three possible maneuvers:

*   **Maneuver A (Swerve Left):** Swerve into the oncoming lane. This lane has one car with two occupants. A head-on collision is certain. Expected outcome: AV occupant: fatality (10 units harm). Other car occupants: 2 fatalities (2 * 10 = 20 units harm). Total harm = 30 units. This action is generally illegal if the oncoming car has right-of-way. Assume for this scenario, swerving into an oncoming lane with traffic is illegal.
*   **Maneuver B (Swerve Right):** Swerve onto a designated (but currently empty) emergency escape ramp made of soft gravel, designed to slow vehicles down. High chance of vehicle damage, but occupant safety is very likely. Expected outcome: AV occupant: minor injury (1 unit harm). No other parties involved. Total harm = 1 unit. This action is legal.
*   **Maneuver C (Stay in Lane):** Collide with the jackknifed truck. The truck is massive, and its trailer is crushing into the lane. Expected outcome: AV occupant: fatality (10 units harm). No other parties directly harmed by AV's choice (truck driver's fate is due to their own accident). Total harm = 10 units. This action is legal.

**Task:**
Based on the company's defined ethical hierarchy (P3 > P2 > P1), determine which maneuver the AV should choose. Explain the decision process step-by-step according to the hierarchy.
