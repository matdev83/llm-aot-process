**Problem 7: The Number Grid Path**

**Domain:** Mathematical Reasoning / Logic

**Problem Statement:**

Consider a 3x3 grid of distinct positive integers:
`A B C`
`D E F`
`G H I`

A path is defined as a sequence of three numbers from the grid, where each subsequent number is chosen from a cell adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to the current cell. A cell cannot be visited more than once in a single path.

You are given the following information:
1.  The sum of all numbers in the grid is 65.
2.  The numbers in the grid are {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, N}, where N is an unknown positive integer.
3.  The number E (center cell) is the average of its four cardinal neighbors (B, D, F, H).
4.  The path `A -> E -> I` (top-left to bottom-right, through center) has a sum of 24.
5.  The path `C -> E -> G` (top-right to bottom-left, through center) has a sum of 20.
6.  B is greater than D.
7.  F is less than H.

**Task:**
Determine the value of N, the value in cell E, and the sets of numbers that occupy the corner positions {A, C, G, I} and the cardinal-middle positions {B, D, F, H}. Finally, discuss if a unique assignment for every cell in the grid is possible with the given information.
