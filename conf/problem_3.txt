**Problem 3: The Levitating Spheres**

**Domain:** Physics-based Reasoning (Conceptual)

**Problem Statement:**

Three identical, non-conducting spheres (A, B, C) are suspended by insulating threads of equal length from a common point. Initially, the spheres are uncharged and hang vertically, just touching each other.
The following sequence of actions is performed:

1.  Sphere A is given a positive charge of `+Q`. Spheres B and C remain uncharged.
2.  Sphere B is then touched to Sphere A, and then separated. (Assume charge distributes evenly on contact between identical spheres).
3.  Sphere C is then touched to Sphere B, and then separated.
4.  Finally, Sphere A is touched to Sphere C, and then separated.

After these operations, the three spheres hang in equilibrium. Due to electrostatic forces, they will repel each other and their threads will make some angle with the vertical.

**Task:**

Rank the final charges on spheres A, B, and C from largest positive charge to smallest positive charge. If any spheres have equal charges, indicate that. Also, qualitatively describe the spatial arrangement of the spheres when viewed from above (e.g., do they form an equilateral triangle, a straight line, an isosceles triangle, etc.?). Assume the charges are large enough for electrostatic forces to be significant compared to gravity, leading to noticeable separation.
